# blog2
Source code for my personal blog. This began as a capstone project for learning fullstack web development and API design and morphed into a fun personal project.

The project is built on node.js using express.js for the server framework, mongodb for the database, and mongoose for the ODM. I chose to use EJS for templating. All authentication and authorizationn is done with passport.js using local strategy and bcrypt for encryption. I plan to add oauth login with google, facebook, twitter, linkedin, and github in the near future.

The website is hosted at http://nodejs-cralford21.rhcloud.com/.
